## Progress/Accomplishments

-   Finishing randomness preprocessing for various model types including linear `Preprocessing Code/preprocess_lm`, tree based `Preprocessing Code/preprocess_tree`, and neural network `Preprocessing Code/preprocess_nn`.
-   Removed countries in dataset with numerous predictors with large missingness.
-   Determined dates to split data into training and testing sets. Training will be data before 2023 and testing will starting 2023.

## Challenges

-   Deciding how to address missingness for predictors with large missingness for different models (i.e. remove predictors in linear, impute large value for trees, create boolean indicators for neural networks).
-   Deciding how to address missingness for new models like ARIMA.

## Next Steps

-   Create a training and testing set for each dataset used for different model types. Also, generate validation sets from training set.
-   Determining how to deal with missingness in the testing set for different models.
-   Apply imputation to random missingness in dataset using clustering by predictor **life_expectancy**.
