## Progress/Accomplishments

-   Added 2 new variables: `month` and `day_of_week`
-   Made training and testing sets for each model (located in `data/finalized_data` folder
    -   Clustered with `life_expectancy`, `female_smokers`, `male_smokers` to impute missingness by cluster median
-   Looked at outliers again using Cook's distance \> 0.5

## Challenges

-   There was still missingness in the testing sets because some data was completely missing (no median could be computed) so we had to impute by training median

## Next Steps

-   Each member will run the 6 models by Nov 10 to provide starting model performance
