## Progress/Accomplishments

-   Added 2 new variables: `month` and `day_of_week`
-   Made training and testing sets for each model (located in `data/finalized_data` folder
    -   Clustered with `life_expectancy`, `female_smokers`, `male_smokers` to impute missingness by cluster median
-   Looked at outliers again using Cook's distance > 0.5
-   Set up tuning scripts for xgboost and arima
    -   Using rolling origin forecast resampling: validation sets for every 3 months train + 1 month test with month increments

## Challenges

-   There was still missingness in the testing sets because some data was completely missing (no median could be computed) so we had to impute by training median
-   We are removing China from list of countries we are using due to different Covid reporting policies there since the data may be unreliable (irreducible error)

## Next Steps

-   Looking into lagged features over the weekend to complete feature engineering

-   Each member will run the 6 models by Nov 10 to provide starting model performance
