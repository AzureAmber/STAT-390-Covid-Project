## Progress/Accomplishments

-   Finalized prediction question: Predicting `new_cases` of COVID-19
-   Completed additional data pre-processing (`Preprocessing Code/adv_preprocessing.R`)
    -   Selected only variables with 70% completion
    -   Addressed multicollinearity
    -   Imputed some missingness issues
        -   `new_deaths`: impute with 0
        -   `total_deaths`, `total_cases`, `reproduction`: replace with the last non-zero value
        -   `new_cases`: replace by change in total cases \<\<\<\<\<\<\< HEAD
        -   `extreme_poverty`: replace by respective continent median extreme_poverty value
-   Researched more about appropriate models to use for classification with R
-   Brought back in some more recent 2023 data for further testing purpose; working to deal with large missingness for some significant predictor variables, especially for countries that just stopped reporting this year

## Challenges

-   Large amount of missing data for predictor variables (ie. **vaccination**, **hospital**, **icu**) in earliest time and more recent data reporting. Trying to narrow down on a time period where at least 60% of data cumulatively is not missing and then apply proper imputation; meanwhile, find if these variables are highly correlated by checking correlation matrix
-   One predictor, `extreme_poverty` has missingness due to specific countries (imputed with geographic average)
-   Determining the time frame for the dataset since early data lacks vaccinations while later data is not collected.

## Next Steps

-   Save finalized dataset to `data/processed_data` folder
-   Split data into training and testing using `time_series_split` with older data for training and most recent data for testing
-   Build recipes & models
