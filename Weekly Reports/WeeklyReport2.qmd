## Progress/Accomplishments

-   Finalized prediction question: Predicting `new_cases` of COVID-19
-   Completed additional data pre-processing (`Preprocessing Code/adv_preprocessing.R`)
    -   Selected only variables with 70% completion
    -   Addressed multicollinearity
    -   Imputed some missingness issues
        -   `new_deaths`: impute with 0
        -   `total_deaths`, `total_cases,`reproduction\`: replace with the last non-zero value
        -   `new_cases`: replace by change in total cases
-   Researched more about appropriate models to use for classification with R

## \## Challenges

-   One predictor, `extreme_poverty` has missingness due to specific countries (imputed with geographic average)
-   Determining the time frame for the dataset since early data lacks vaccinations while later data is not collected.

## Next Steps

-   Save finalized dataset to `data/processed_data` folder
-   Split data into training and testing
-   Build recipes & models
